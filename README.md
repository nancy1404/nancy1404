# 👋 Hi, I'm Nancy (Nakyung) Kwak!

🎓 2nd-year **Statistics & Data Science** student at UT Austin  
🤖 **Break Through Tech AI Fellow** @ Cornell Tech (AI/ML for real-world impact)  
📈 Interested in **business & marketing analytics, sports analytics, and operations**  

I like using data to answer questions that actually change decisions:  
- Which pumps should engineers fix *first* to minimize downtime?  
- How should a team think about player performance after switching leagues?  
- What kind of content strategy drives better engagement and retention?

Right now, I’m building end-to-end workflows — from messy CSVs to models, and then to **clear recommendations** for non-technical stakeholders.

## 🎯 Featured Project — [Google YouTube Virality](https://github.com/BrendaG04/Google1D.git)

**YouTube Video Virality & Longevity (Break Through Tech AI Fellowship)**  
*Team project on ~2.9M rows across 11 countries*

- Built a **YouTube virality pipeline** to study how engagement and metadata drive trending outcomes  
- Engineered features like views-per-day and engagement ratios for cross-country comparison  
- Modeled posting scenarios to suggest strategies that could improve **click-through and watch-time**  
- Practiced “analytics as a product”: reproducible notebooks, clean repo, and clear takeaways for content teams  

> **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, Jupyter, Git/GitHub

### 🔧 [Rod Pump Failure Analysis (NSC 325 x ConocoPhillips)](https://github.com/nancy1404/rod-pump-failure)
*Industry-collaborative ML project on ~2,600 wells (NSC 325: Inventors Program – Energy)*

- Cleaned and engineered **50+ operational, mechanical, and fluid features** from ConocoPhillips well data (raw data private; pipeline open-sourced in the repo)  
- Trained **logistic regression and random forest** models to predict rod pump failure, focusing on **high recall on the failure class** while keeping false alarms manageable  
- Ran **bootstrapping and Monte Carlo simulations** to quantify model uncertainty and built simple **risk + cost scenarios** to show how thresholds affect downtime and maintenance spend  

> **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Jupyter, Git/GitHub

## 🚀 Other Projects

### ⚾ KBO Baseball Stats Analysis & Shiny App
*Sports analytics + interactive visualization*

- Built an R Shiny app to explore **KBO player statistics** and their relationship to team success  
- Used `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and Shiny components to create a **fan- and analyst-friendly** interface  
- Focused on asking “front-office style” questions about player value and team construction  

> Tools: R, Shiny, dplyr, ggplot2

### 📊 Causal Performance Study — NPB Hitters Adjusting to MLB
*Course project for SDS 375 Sports Analytics*

- Modeled how switching from **NPB to MLB** affects hitters’ wOBA over their first two MLB seasons  
- Used linear and ridge regression with **age covariates and aging curves** to separate league effects from natural aging  
- Framed insights for **front-office decisions**: realistic expectations, contract planning, and playing time  

> Tools: R, regression modeling, sports analytics

## 🌱 What I’m Learning / Working On

- Designing ML pipelines that are **reproducible and explainable**, not just accurate  
- Getting better at **storytelling with data** for non-technical audiences (slides, written reports, and live presentations)  
- Exploring more structured **business analytics**: KPIs, revenue/retention metrics, and marketing experiments  

If it’s about connecting data → decisions → real impact, I’m probably interested.

## 🤝 Leadership & Community

Outside of coursework, I care a lot about **access, mentorship, and community-building**:

- **Undergraduate Korean Association – Professional Development Chair**  
  - Run alumni & recruiting events and manage a mentorship pipeline for ~200 students  

- **Natural Sciences Council – Student–Faculty Committee Member**  
  - Represent SDS majors and co-founded a peer-led Coding Lab for introductory CS/SDS courses  

- **Student Engineers Educating Kids (SEEK) – Program Officer**  
  - Coordinate a 9-week STEM workshop series at a Title I school  

- **WiSTEM – Outreach Ambassador & STEM Girl Day Coordinator**  
  - Support large-scale outreach events (e.g., Girl Day) bringing thousands of K–8 students and families to campus  

- **Family Volunteer Group – Founder**  
  - Started a 22-family volunteer group partnering with a Lifelong Education Center in Seoul, supporting students with developmental disabilities

## ✨ Fun Facts

- Baseball analytics was my gateway into statistics, and I still check box scores like they’re emails.
- I love building small systems for people—mentoring programs, volunteer groups, anything that helps someone feel less lost.
- When I’m tired of code, I switch to writing short web dramas or journaling in Korean.
- I used to play percussion and drumline, so I still count everything in 8s.
