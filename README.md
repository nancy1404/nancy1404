## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔧 [Rod Pump Failure Prediction](https://github.com/chaconnb/NSC325_ROADFAIL_TEAM2.git)
Used Random Forest & XGBoost to classify failure types and predict lifetimes on real oilfield data (n=1,977).  
→ Reached 91.3% recall on binary classification.  
→ Featured engineering: log transforms, pressure ratios, Monte Carlo simulation.

### 📈 [KBO Baseball Stats Analysis & Shiny App]()
Developed an interactive R Shiny app visualizing KBO player statistics and their correlation with team success.  
→ Used ggplot2, dplyr, and Shiny dashboard components for UI.
